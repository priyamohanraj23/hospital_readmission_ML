# hospital_readmission_ML
End-to-end ML pipeline to predict 30-day hospital readmissions using data preprocessing, feature selection, and ensemble models.

# 🏥 Hospital Patient Readmission Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days using machine learning techniques. Early prediction helps healthcare providers take preventive measures and reduce readmission rates.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Hospital readmissions increase healthcare costs and indicate potential gaps in patient care. The objective is to build a classification model that identifies high-risk patients.
